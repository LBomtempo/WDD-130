                <p>Here, our customers will be able to search for other people willing to take care of their 
                    pets in various ways in order to find the perfect place for their pets. The main and easier 
                    option is a map, in which they will visualize the location of the people willing to provide 
                    this service whom we call "pet sitters", or if they prefer, they can filter the results according 
                    to the profile, including the type of place, allowed breeds and other characteristics. When you 
                    find the ideal pet sitter for your furry little one, you will be able to view the agenda and 
                    schedule an appointment according to their availability. Once scheduled, you'll have access 
                    to the pet sitter's profile and be able to exchange messages with them to match your pet's 
                    schedule and special needs. After defining the details of your pet's stay, payment can be made 
                    through the platform, according to the payment methods accepted by the pet sitter.</p>
