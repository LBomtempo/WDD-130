        <h1> My Pets</h1>
          Having a pet means having lots of love and loyal company at home, but we know that this can 
          demand a lot of you and your family. Unlike most humans, your pet does not need material 
          goods or academic studies to be happy, however, what he needs is something very precious 
          that you have, your time and your attention. To ensure your pet is happy and healthy, in 
          addition to feeding and vaccinations, you will need to spend some time with him to play 
          and develop bonds. We know that it's not always possible to give them all the attention 
          they deserve, that's why My Pets was created especially for people who love their pets 
          and don't want them to be alone or miss out on the appropriate amount of care, love, and 
          attention because of a busy routine. Here, these people will be able to find a fun, 
          comfortable, and safe place where their pets will be taken care of by people who also 
          love animals, while they are away taking care of their other responsibilities or even 
          traveling. Our goal is to ensure the safety and well-being of your pet. Only here, at 
          My Pets will you find people willing to take care of their pets the same way you would 
          if you were with them.

      <h3>Introducing: My Pets</h3>
      <p>
        <h1>Make Pet-Sitting Easy</h1>
          Here, our customers will be able to search for other people willing to take care of their 
          pets in various ways in order to find the perfect place for their pets. The main and easier 
          option is a map, in which they will visualize the location of the people willing to provide 
          this service whom we call "pet sitters", or if they prefer, they can filter the results according 
          to the profile, including the type of place, allowed breeds and other characteristics. When you 
          find the ideal pet sitter for your furry little one, you will be able to view the agenda and 
          schedule an appointment according to their availability. Once scheduled, you'll have access 
          to the pet sitter's profile and be able to exchange messages with them to match your pet's 
          schedule and special needs. After defining the details of your pet's stay, payment can be made 
          through the platform, according to the payment methods accepted by the pet sitter.

          <h1>Our Partners Will Take Care of Your Loved Ones</h1>
          All our pet sitters are registered in our database and go through a careful profile and 
          background verification to ensure that they are able to provide a quality and reliable service 
          so that you can have peace of mind while you are away from your loved little one. We make previous 
          inspections in their places to make sure it is safe and has enough space to accommodate animals. 
          You will also be able to see on the website if the pet sitter has any additional skills as a 
          trainer or veterinarian. My Pets was created exclusively to provide connections between people 
          who need someone to take care of their pets and for people who are available to take care of them 
          in their places, if the pet sitter has some additional training these services can be negotiated 
          outside the platform.

          <h1>Important Information</h1>
          To use My Pets services, make sure that your pet is adequately vaccinated and does not have any 
          health restrictions to be in contact with other animals and other people. It is also important 
          to ensure that he feels comfortable in the environment where he will stay, we recommend that you 
          schedule a visit in advance so that your pet gets to know the new place and gets used to it. If 
          the place already has other animals, it is important to ensure that all animals will maintain a 
          peaceful and harmonious behavior.
