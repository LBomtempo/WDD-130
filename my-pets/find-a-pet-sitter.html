                <p>All our pet sitters are registered in our database and go through a careful profile and 
                    background verification to ensure that they are able to provide a quality and reliable service 
                    so that you can have peace of mind while you are away from your loved little one. We make previous 
                    inspections in their places to make sure it is safe and has enough space to accommodate animals.</p>

                <p>You will also be able to see on the website if the pet sitter has any additional skills as a 
                    trainer or veterinarian. My Pets was created exclusively to provide connections between people 
                    who need someone to take care of their pets and for people who are available to take care of them 
                    in their places, if the pet sitter has some additional training these services can be negotiated 
                    outside the platform.</p>

                <p>To use My Pets services, make sure that your pet is adequately vaccinated and does not have any 
                    health restrictions to be in contact with other animals and other people. It is also important 
                    to ensure that he feels comfortable in the environment where he will stay, we recommend that you 
                    schedule a visit in advance so that your pet gets to know the new place and gets used to it. If 
                    the place already has other animals, it is important to ensure that all animals will maintain a 
                    peaceful and harmonious behavior.</p>

                <h2>We Make Pet-Sitting Easy</h2>
                <p>Having a pet means having lots of love and loyal company at home, but we know that this can 
                    demand a lot of you and your family. Unlike most humans, your pet does not need material 
                    goods or academic studies to be happy, however, what he needs is something very precious 
                    that you have, your time and your attention. To ensure your pet is happy and healthy, in 
                    addition to feeding and vaccinations, you will need to spend some time with him to play 
                    and develop bonds. We know that it's not always possible to give them all the attention 
                    they deserve, that's why My Pets was created especially for people who love their pets 
                    and don't want them to be alone or miss out on the appropriate amount of care, love, and 
                    attention because of a busy routine. Here, these people will be able to find a fun, 
                    comfortable, and safe place where their pets will be taken care of by people who also 
                    love animals, while they are away taking care of their other responsibilities or even 
                    traveling. Our goal is to ensure the safety and well-being of your pet. Only here, at 
                    My Pets will you find people willing to take care of their pets the same way you would 
                    if you were with them.
