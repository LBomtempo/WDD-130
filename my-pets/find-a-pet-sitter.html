                <p id="card-p1">All our pet sitters are registered in our database and go through a careful profile and 
                    background verification to ensure that they are able to provide a quality and reliable service 
                    so that you can have peace of mind while you are away from your loved little one. We make previous 
                    inspections in their places to make sure it is safe and has enough space to accommodate animals.</p>
                <img id="card-img2" src="images/find-petsitter2.jpg" alt="Dogs in line">
                <p id="card-p2">You will also be able to see on the website if the pet sitter has any additional skills as a 
                    trainer or veterinarian. My Pets was created exclusively to provide connections between people 
                    who need someone to take care of their pets and for people who are available to take care of them 
                    in their places, if the pet sitter has some additional training these services can be negotiated 
                    outside the platform.</p>

                <p id="card-p3">To use My Pets services, make sure that your pet is adequately vaccinated and does not have any 
                    health restrictions to be in contact with other animals and other people. It is also important 
                    to ensure that he feels comfortable in the environment where he will stay, we recommend that you 
                    schedule a visit in advance so that your pet gets to know the new place and gets used to it.</p>
