<h2>Lucas</h2>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Lucas and I am from Bras√≠lia, Brazil. I've
been married for almost 4 years with my lovely wife Rute. We don't
have children yet, but we have a very cute and fluffy dog named Maggie.</p>
<p>I have been a member since I was 9 and had the great blessing to 
grow up with wonderful church member friends, with whom I learned with
and shared great experiences while serving missions at the same time.</p>
<p>In my career so far, I have worked as a system and business consultant
and I love what I do. I haven't worked directly with programming and 
development yet, this is why I started this degree program at BYU. I hope to 
get to know the most about web development, especially how to make pages look
beautiful, though I am not good at arts and design.</p>
