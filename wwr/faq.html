                <h3>What is included in my white water raft trip?</h3>
                <p>With every raft trip at FastWater Sea Trips, guests will get a paddle, life jacket, 
                    bail bucket and water resistant bucket to use for the day. If you are on a Family

                <h3>Are the river guides in our raft?</h3>
                <p>Our professional guides will be in kayaks alongside your raft. If you have special 
                    needs or feel you would like a river guide in the raft with you, we would be happy 
                    to do so for a $70.00 fee, based upon availability. Please call us at least two weeks 
                    prior to your trip date to check availability and have this service added to your 
                    reservation.  Keep in mind that in-raft guides are not available on Whitewater Dam 
                    Release Saturdays in July & August.</p>

                <h3>Do we need to fill out a liability waiver to go white water rafting?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Every person that is rafting at FastWater Sea Trips is required to fill out one 
                    of our liability waivers when you arrive.  All rafting guests that are under the 
                    age of 18 will also need a signature from a parent or guardian. Liability waivers 
                    that coordinate with your trip time will be given to each guest at check-in. Groups
                    of 30 or more guests can download our liability waivers, fill them out, and bring 
                    them the day of your trip.</p>

                <h3>What happens if it rains?</h3>
                <p>At Fastwater Sea Trips, we run our rafting trips rain or shine. If you decide that you 
                    donâ€™t want to raft in rain or similar weather, you can reschedule your trip or cancel 
                    your reservation. In accordance to our cancellation policy, if you cancel within 10 
                    days of your trip, we will send you passes to come back and raft with us. These passes 
                    will be valid for up to 2 years.</p>
